### Method OverRiding
# Run-Time polymorphism # Dynamic polymorphism

- Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

- Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class, and the method called will be determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
