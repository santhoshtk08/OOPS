### Method OverLoading

- Also known as Compile Time Polymorphism (or) Static polymorphism

- In Java, method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but with different parameters. 

- The key to method overloading is that the methods must have a different number, type, or order of parameters.

- This allows you to use the same method name for different behaviors based on the input arguments.
